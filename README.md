# Messenger

A one-to-one realtime chat app.

## Local Setup

Create the PostgreSQL database (these instructions may need to be adapted for your operating system):

```
psql
CREATE DATABASE messenger;
\q
```

Alternatively, if you have docker installed, you can use it to spawn a postgres instance on your machine:

```
docker run -it -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=<database-name> -e POSTGRES_USER=<database-username> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<database-password> postgres -c log_statement=all
```

Update db.js to connect with your local PostgreSQL set up. The [Sequelize documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) can help with this.

Create a .env file in the server directory and add your session secret (this can be any string):

```
SESSION_SECRET = "your session secret"
```

In the server folder, install dependencies and then seed the database:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run seed
```

In the client folder, install dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
```

### Running the Application Locally

In one terminal, start the front end:

```
cd client
npm start
```

In a separate terminal, start the back end:

```
cd server
npm run dev
```

## How to Run E2E Tests

1. Seed the database with `npm run seed` in `server` directory.
1. Start the backend server with `npm run dev` in `server` directory.
1. Start the frontend server with `npm start` in `client` directory.
1. Open Cypress dashboard with `npx cypress open` in `client` directory.
1. Click on the test suite to run (e.g. `auth.spec.js`).

#### Notes

- You need to seed the database before each run. Because E2E test cases writes data to
  the actual database, re-seeding is necessary to assure consistent test results.
- The E2E tests are not comprehensive.
  There is a test for the authentication pages that should pass with the starting code,
  and some tests for some of the functionality for some of the tickets you will be assigned.
- When you push your changes to GitHub, E2E tests are automatically executed on GitHub Actions.
  You can find test results under Pull request > Checks > test > Cypress (see screenshots below).
